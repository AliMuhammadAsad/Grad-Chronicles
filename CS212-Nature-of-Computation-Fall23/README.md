This repository contains all the notes, lectures, assignments, weekly challenges and stuff related to the course ```CS212 - Nature of Computation``` offered in Fall 2023. This course is the equivalent course that many universities offer and is more famously known as ```Theory of Automata```. However, a very abstract course. The course book was ```Introduction to the Theory of Computation``` by Michael Sipser.

This ```README``` will be updated along the way.
