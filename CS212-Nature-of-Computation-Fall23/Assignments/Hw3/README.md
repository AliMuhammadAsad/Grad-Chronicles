# Homework 3: Turing Machine, Variants, Decidability, and Recognizability
# CS 212 Nature of Computation, Fall 2023

---

# Purpose

This homework includes problems on Turing machines, equivalence of computational models, decidability, and recognizability.

# Background

For this assignment, you should
- read and write formal notation
- recall the definition of a Turing Machine in various forms: high-level, implementation-level, and formal
- design and describe a Turing machine
- prove equivalence of a variant with a Turing machine
- recall the definition of a decidable language
- recall the definition of a recognizable language
- recall the definition of a language
- recall the Chomsky hierarchy of languages
- argue about the decidability and recognizability of a given languages

# The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw3.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Submission and Grading
