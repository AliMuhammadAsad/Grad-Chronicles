# Background

For this assignment, you should
- design a grammar for a given language
- infer the language of a given grammar
- construct a parse tree for a string under a given grammar
- argue about the ambiguity of a grammar
- use the pumping lemma to argue about the regularity of a language

# The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw2.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Submission and Grading
