    % Question 1
    \titledquestion{Bill or a Phone number?}

    In Meowland, a valid phone number consists of $5$ digits with no leading zeros.

    For example, $98765$, $10000$, $71023$ are valid numbers while $04123$ and $9231$ are not.

    Chef went to a store and purchased $N$ items, where the cost of each item is $X$.

    Given $N$ and $X$, find whether the total bill is equivalent to a valid phone number.

    \heading{Constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $N,X \in \mathbb{N}$
        \item $1 \le N,X \le 1000$
    \end{itemize}

    \heading{Interaction}

    The input comprises a single line containing 2 space-separated integers denoting the values of $N$ and $X$ respectively.

    The output must contain a string containing either $YES$, if the total bill is equivalent to a valid phone number and $NO$ otherwise.

        25 785 & YES    \\\hline
        402 11 & NO     \\\hline
    \end{tabularx}

    In the first case, $(N,X)=(25,785)$. Chef bought $25$ items, each with cost $785$. The total bill is thus $25 * 785 = 19625$. This is a valid phone number and the output is ``YES''.

    In the second case, $(N,X)=(402,11)$. Chef bought $402$ items that cost $11$ each. The total bill is thus $402 * 11 = 4422$. This is not a valid phone number and the output is ``NO''.

    \titledquestion{Figuring out the salary}

    After consultation with your financial advisor, you have devised the following payment scheme at your startup. An employee's \textit{gross salary} is the sum of their basic salary, HRA, and DA. If the basic salary is less than $\$ 1500$, then HRA = $10\%$ of the basic salary and DA = $90\%$ of the basic salary. Otherwise, HRA = $\$ 500$ and DA = $98\%$ of the basic salary.

    Given $S$, the basic salary of an employee, as input, output their gross salary.

    \heading{Constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $S \inn$
        \item $1 \le S \le 100000$
    \end{itemize}


    \heading{Interaction}

    The input comprises a single line containing containing the value of $S$.

    The output must contain a single number upto 2 decimal places denoting the gross salary of the employee.

        10042 & 20383.16 \\\hline
    \end{tabularx}

    In the first case, $S=1203$. The value of $S$ is less than $1500$ therefore, $HRA = 10\% = 120.3$, and $DA = 90\% = 1082.7$. Therefore the gross salary = $1203+120.3+1082.7 = 2406.00$

    In the second case, $S=10042$. The value of $S$ is greater than $1500$ therefore, $HRA = RS.500$, and $DA = 98\% = 9841.16$. Therefore the gross salary = $10042 + 500 + 9841.16 = 20383.16$

    \titledquestion{Fitness Fun}

    In order to promote physical fitness, Liebling University is holding a trek along trails of length $100$ km, $210$ km and $420$km. Students who complete any trek within $D$ days will win a prize of amount $A,B,$ and $C$ respectively ($A<B<C$) . There can be multiple winners for a trek and a student can participate in only one trek.

    Given the distance $d$km that Chef can cover in a single day, find the maximum prize that she can win at the end of $D$ days.

    \heading{Constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $d,D,A,B,C \inn$
        \item $1 \le D \le 25$

        \item $1 \le A < B < C \le 100000$
    \end{itemize}


    \heading{Interaction}

    The input contains a single line containing five space-separated integers $D,d,A,B,C.$

    The output must contain an integer indicating the maximum prize that Chef can win. The output must be $0$ if no prize can be won.

    \end{tabularx}

    In the first case, $(D,d,A,B,C)=(10,5,100,200,300)$. The distance covered by Chef in 10 days is $10\times5=50km$ which is less than any of the available distance categories. Hence Chef won't be able to claim any prize.

    In the second case, $(D,d,A,B,C)=(20,14,15000,20000,30000)$. The distance covered by Chef in 20 days is $20\times15=3000km$ which satisfies the first and second treks but not the third. Hence Chef can claim a maximum prize of $20000$.

    \titledquestion{Penalty Shots}

    In a football tournament, the final match has reached the penalty stage. Each team is given $5$ shots at the goal and the team that scores a goal on the most number of shots wins the game. If both the teams' scores an equal number of goals, then the game is considered a draw and there will be $2$ champions.

    We are given ten integers $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J$ where $A,C,E,G,I$ values represent the goals of the first team and $B,D,F,H,J$ values represent the goals of team $2$. A value of $1$ indicates that a goal was scored and a value of $0$ indicates that a goal was not scored.

    Determine the winner or find if the game ends in a draw.

    \heading{Constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J \in \{0,1\}$
    \end{itemize}


    \heading{Interaction}

    The input contains a single line containing $10$ space-separated integers indicating the values of $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J.$

    The output must contain a single integer - $0$ if the game ends in a draw, $1$ if the first team wins, or $2$ if the second team wins.

    In the first case, $(A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J) = (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)$. No team scores any goal, so the game ends in a draw and $0$ is the output.

    In the second case, $(A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J) = (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1)$. The second team is able to score in their final shot, while the first team has scored no goals and hence the second team wins and $2$ is the output.

    \titledquestion{Vacation}

      You finally get the time to go on a vacation after a tough semester. You have planned for two trips during this vacation---one with your family and the second with your friends.
      
    The family trip will take $X$ days and the trip with friends will take $Y$ days.Currently, the dates are not decided but the vacation will last only for $Z$ days.

    You can only be in at most one trip at any time and once a trip is started, you must complete it before the vacation ends. Planning and packing are already done and will not take time.

    Given $X,Y,$ and $Z$, you want to see if you will you be able to go on both the trips?

    \heading{Interaction}

    The input comprises a single line containing 3 space-separated integers denoting the values of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ respectively.

    The output must contain a single string---``YES'' if you can go on both the trips and ``NO'' if not.

    \titledquestion{Gold Digger}

    On a vacation with $N$ friends, Chef stumbled upon a gold mine and dug it all up. The total amount of gold is $X$ kg. Every person has the capacity of carrying up \textit{at most} $Y$ kg of gold. Note that including Chef, there are a total of $(N+1)$ people.

    Given $N,X$ and $Y$, will Chef and her friends be able to carry all the gold from the gold mine in a single go?

    \titledquestion{Car Choice}

    Your class has come together to gift Chef a new car for her birthday. After a long search, you are left with 2 choices:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Car 1: Runs on diesel with a fuel economy of $x_1$ km/l.
        \item Car 2: Runs on petrol with a fuel economy of $x_2$ km/l.
    \end{itemize}

    You also know the current prices of petrol and diesel.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item the current price of diesel is $y_1$ rupees per litre.
        \item the current price of petrol is $y_2$ rupees per litre.
    \end{itemize}

    You are going to choose the car based on the price of driving each car, assuming that the price of fuel remains the same?
