    % Question 1
    \titledquestion{Taking a flight}
    Amna is getting on a flight and has 3 bags with her. She will submit 2 of them for check-in, and will take 1 to the airplane cabin with her as carry-on. The bags weigh \pyth{A}, \pyth{B}, and \pyth{C} kg each. The airline restricts, for a single passenger, the sum of the weights of the checked-in bags to no more than \pyth{D} kg and of the carry-on bags to no more than \pyth{E} kg. In case of excess, the passenger has to pay a fine.

    Given \pyth{A, B, C, D}, and \pyth{E}, Find out if Amna can take her bags with her without having to pay a fine.

    \heading{Constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $A,B,C,D,E \inn$
        \item $1 \le A,B,C \le 10$
        \item $15 \le D \le 20$
        \item $5\le E \le 10$
    \end{itemize}

    \heading{Interaction}

    The input comprises a single line containing 5 space separated integers denoting the values of \pyth{A,B,C,D} and \pyth{E} respectively.

    The output should contain a single word, \pyth{YES}, if Amna can take the flight without paying a fine, and \pyth{NO} if she will have to pay a fine.

    \titledquestion{Cricket}

      In a season of cricket, the statistics of players are noted in three categories: wickets (\pyth{W}), runs (\pyth{R}), and catches (\pyth{C}).

      A player is considered better \textit{in a category} than another player if their statistics in that category are higher. It is possible for a player to be better than another player in one category but worse in another. A player is better \textit{overall} than another player if their statistics are higher in 2 or more categories.

    Given the stats of Player A and Player B, denoted by $(R_1,W_1,C_1)$ and $(R_2,W_2,C_2)$ respectively, we want to determine which is the better player.

    \heading{Constraints}

        \item $0 \le W_1, W_2 \le 20$
        \item $0 \le C_1, C_2 \le 20$
    \end{itemize}

    \heading{Interaction}

    The input comprises a single line containing 6 space-separated integers denoting the values of $R_1,W_1,C_1,R_2,W_2,C_2$ respectively.

    The output must contain a single letter denoting which player is better: \pyth{A} for player A, \pyth{B} for player 2,  and \pyth{T} for a tie.

    \end{tabularx}

    In the first case, $(R_1,W_1,C_1,R_2,W_2,C_2)=(0,1,2,2,3,4)$. Player B is better than Player A in all 3 categories.

    In the second case, $(R_1,W_1,C_1,R_2,W_2,C_2)=(10,10,10,8,10,8)$. Player A is better than Player B in 2 categories.

    \titledquestion{Hilda in the Enchanted Forest}
    Exploring the woods near her home, Hilda wanders into an enchanted forest that was full of surprises. She slipped into a marsh which altered her movement strangely. Whenever she made a forward movement, the marsh moved her forward by $3$ steps and forced a backward movement of $1$ step on her. It was as if the forest was playing tricks on her. Determined as she was to see what lay beyond the forest, Hilda pressed on.

    Having made $k$ total movements by now, Hilda wants to know how many steps she has advanced. Help Hilda find out how many steps ahead she is of her starting point.

    \titledquestion{Inheritance problem}
      Nearing the end of his life, Bajwa is thinking of distributing his assets among his children. He has $X$ properties worth $1$ billion each and $Y$ properties worth $2$ billion each. He wants to distribute these among his two children such that the total value of each share in billions is the same. If it is not, he will have to coerce some lawyer to look into the finer details.

    \titledquestion{Vaccination Dates}

    Chef took the first dose of vaccine $D$ days ago. The second dose must be taken no less than $L$ days and no more than $R$ days after the first dose.

    Given $D$, $L$ and $R$, determine if Chef is too early, too late, or in the correct range for taking the second dose.



    \heading{Constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $D,L,R\inn$

        \item $1 \le L \le R \le 10^9$
    \end{itemize}


    \heading{Interaction}

    The input contains a single line containing the space-separated integers indicating the values of  $D,L,R.$ respectively.

    The output must contain a string---``Too Early'' if it's too early to take the vaccine, ``Too Late'' if it's too late to take the vaccine, or ``Take second dose now'' if it's the correct time to take the vaccine.

    \titledquestion{Fitness Fun}

    In order to promote physical fitness, Liebling University is holding a trek along trails of length $100$ km, $210$ km and $420$ km. Students who complete any trek within $D$ days will win a prize of amount $A,B,$ and $C$ respectively ($A<B<C$) . There can be multiple winners for a trek and a student can participate in only one trek.

    Given the distance, $d$ km, that Chef can cover in a single day, find the maximum prize that she can win at the end of $D$ days.

    \heading{Constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $D,d,A,B,C \inn$
        \item $1 \le D \le 25$
        \item $1 \le d \le 500$
        \item $1 \le A < B < C \le 100000$
    \end{itemize}


    \heading{Interaction}

    The input contains a single line containing five space-separated integers denoting the values of $D,d,A,B,$ and $C$ respectively.

    The output must contain an integer indicating the maximum prize that Chef can win. The output must be $0$ if no prize can be won.

        20 15 15000 20000 30000 & 20000      \\\hline
    \end{tabularx}

    In the first case, $(D,d,A,B,C)=(10,5,100,200,300)$. The distance covered by Chef in 10 days is $10\times5=50$ km which is less than any of the available distance categories. Hence Chef won't be able to claim any prize.

    In the second case, $(D,d,A,B,C)=(20,15,15000,20000,30000)$. The distance covered by Chef in 20 days is $20\times15=300$ km which satisfies the first and second treks but not the third. Hence Chef can claim a maximum prize of $20000$.

    \titledquestion{Bill or a Phone number?}

    Chef is visiting Meowland, where a valid phone number consists of $5$ digits with no leading zeros. For example, $98765$, $10000$, $71023$ are valid numbers while $04123$ and $9231$ are not. At a store, Chef purchased $N$ items, costing $\$X$ each.

    Given $N$ and $X$, find whether the total bill is equivalent to a valid phone number.

    \heading{Constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $N,X \in \mathbb{N}$
        \item $1 \le N,X \le 1000$
    \end{itemize}

    \heading{Interaction}

    The input comprises a single line containing 2 space-separated integers denoting the values of $N$ and $X$ respectively.

    The output must contain a string containing either $YES$, if the total bill is equivalent to a valid phone number and $NO$ otherwise.

    \rowcolors{2}{gray!25}{white}

        25 785 & YES    \\\hline
        402 11 & NO     \\\hline
    \end{tabularx}

    In the first case, $(N,X)=(25,785)$. Chef bought $25$ items, each with cost $785$. The total bill is thus $25 * 785 = 19625$. This is a valid phone number and the output is ``YES''.

    In the second case, $(N,X)=(402,11)$. Chef bought $402$ items that cost $11$ each. The total bill is thus $402 * 11 = 4422$. This is not a valid phone number and the output is ``NO''.
