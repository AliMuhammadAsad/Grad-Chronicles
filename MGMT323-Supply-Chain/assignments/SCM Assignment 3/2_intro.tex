\section{Introduction}

The Fourth Industrial Revolution, marked by advancements in automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT), has transformed industries by enabling intelligent systems to address longstanding challenges. In supply chain management, traditional processes often suffer from inefficiencies caused by manual operations, fragmented communication, and outdated technologies, leading to delays, increased costs, and environmental impacts. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer a transformative solution to these challenges by leveraging technologies such as machine learning, LiDAR sensors, and IoT for enhanced operational efficiency, safety, and sustainability. This paper explores the transformative potential of autonomous vehicles in supply chain management by presenting a detailed case study of Toyota, highlighting its innovative applications of AV technology to overcome supply chain inefficiencies and revolutionize logistics operations.
