\section{Introduction of Autonomous Vehicles}

The industrial revolution characterized by the convergence of automation, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT), has paved way for autonomous vehicles to redesign and redefine transporation, logistics and supply chain management since the digitalization is not only the manufacturing process upgrade, but also logistics and intelligent transport solutions \cite{ref1}. Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have the potential of providing more efficient logistics and passanger transfer methods. AVs make the use of advanced sensors, machine learning algorithms, and interconnected systems to provide efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Smart sensors such as LiDAR, along with the implementation of cognitive computing and IoT represents an AV as a cyber-physical system (CPS), within which information from all related perspectives is closely monitored and synchronized between the physical devices and the cyber computational space \cite{ref1}. By utilizing advanced information analytics, AVs will undoubtedly be able to perform more efficiently, collaboratively, safely, and resiliently, thus making it possible to integrate AVs with Industry 4.0.
