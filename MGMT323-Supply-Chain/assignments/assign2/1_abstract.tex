\section{Abstract}

Industry 4.0, synonymous with smart manufacturing, is the fourth industrial revolution that is characterized by the integration of digital technologies into the manufacturing sector. Industry 4.0 technologies revolutionalize the automation, monitoring, and analysis of supply chains through smart technologies. Autonomous Vehicles have emerged as a transformative innovation in modern technology, embodying the principles of Industry 4.0 of automation and integration of digital technologies. This report would take a closer look into Autonomous Vehicles and Industry 4.0, by first introducing the Autonomous Vechicles and their importance in the modern world, followed by their integration into Industry 4.0. The report then looks into the theoretical aspects of Autonomous Vehicles and Industry 4.0, followed by a discussion on the benefits of integrating Autonomous Vehicles into Industry 4.0, concluding with some problem statements for which Autonomous Vehicles can provide solutions. The report is a culmination of extensive brainstorming, review of case studies, and relevant research publications on Autonomous Vehicles and their role in Industry 4.0.
