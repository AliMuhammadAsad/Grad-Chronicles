  Following the recent \href{https://www.facebook.com/karachi.usconsulate/posts/pfbid0sb9UC6H9KPnS7fmHSpNQiHQrzXDAFhRKwWRiLD7tjDwQpyuUQKrm6vXfYH2xYUG9l}{speaker on ``Diversity, Equity \& Inclusion''} from the US of A, HU is undertaking an accessibility audit of the city campus and has enlisted a greatest algorithmicist, yourself! You have identified $n$ distinct locations on campus connected by various passages. Each passage is passable with a wheelchair, without a wheelchair, or both. It makes its endpoints mutually reachable.

  In the audit, a passage is \textit{Type A} if it is passable with a wheelchair, and \textit{Type B} if it is passable without a wheelchair. Two locations, $u$ and $v$, are \textit{A-accessible} if there is a sequence of Type A passages between them. A similar definition applies for \textit{B-accessible}.

  The campus is \textit{DEI-compliant} and clears the audit if any two distinct locations, $u$ and $v$, are A-accessible if and only if they are B-accessible.

  \subsection*{Input \& Constraints}
  The first line contains 2 integers, $n$ and $q$. ($1\leq n \leq 10^5, 1\leq q \leq 2\cdot 10^5$)
  \\
  Each of the $q$ subsequent lines specifies a passage of Type A or Type B between $u$ and $v$. ($1\leq u,v \leq n$)
  
  \subsection*{Output}
  Compute and return $q$ \texttt{bool} values. The $i$-th value indicates whether addition of the $i$-th passage makes the campus DEI-compliant.

    \underline{Explanation}\\
    After the 1st passage is added, locations 1 and 2 are A-accessible but are not B-accessible, so the campus is not DEI-compliant.\\
    The same reasoning applies after adding the 2nd and 3rd passages.\\
    After the 4th passage is added, the campus is DEI-compliant as all pairs of locations are now A-accessible if and only if they are B-accessible.\\
    After the 5th, 6th and 7th passages are added, locations 3 and 4 are A-accessible but not B-accessible.\\
    After the 8th passage is added,  the campus is DEI-compliant as all pairs of locations are now A-accessible if and only if they are B-accessible.\\
  \end{minipage}

  \subsection*{Tasks}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Implement the function, \texttt{connect\_campus}, in the accompanying file, \texttt{test\_campus.py}. Pay attention to the parameter and return types.
  \item Run \texttt{pytest test\_campus.py} locally in order to identify and debug any errors.
  \item Adhere to good attribution practices: make sure to cite any sources or references, \href{https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/2616/discussion_topics/29240}{especially if using AI}.
  \end{enumerate}
