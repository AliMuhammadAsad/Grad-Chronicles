\begin{questions}
  \question
  \textbf{1. } Let $ f(n) $ and $ g(n) $ be asymptotically non-negative functions. Using the basic definition of $ \Theta $-notation, prove that $ max\{f(n), g(n)\} = \Theta(f(n) + g(n)) $.
  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

  \question
  \textbf{2. } Prove or disprove the statements below.
  \begin{solution}
    \begin{parts}
      \part $ (n + 1)^2 = n^2 + O(n) $
      \part $ n + O(\sqrt(n))(n + O(\log(n)))^2 = n^3 + O(\sqrt{n^5}) $
      \part exp($ O(1) $) = $ O(e^n) $
      \part $ n^{\log(n)} = O((\log n)^n) $
      \part $ 2^{2n} = O(2^n) $
    \end{parts}
  \end{solution}

  \question
  \textbf{3. } Prove that for any two functions $ f(n) $ and $ g(n) $, we have $ f(n) = \Theta(g(n)) $ if and only if $ f(n) = O(g(n)) $ and $ f(n) = \Omega(g(n)) $.
  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

  \question
  \textbf{4. } Prove that for $ S \subseteq \mathbb{Z} $, $$ \sum_{k \in S} \Theta(f(k)) = \Theta \biggl\{ \sum_{k \in S} f(k) \biggr\} $$ assuming both sums converge.
  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

  \question
  \textbf{5. } Is $ 2^{n + 1} = O(2^n)$? Is $ 2^{2n} = O(2^n) $? 

\end{questions}
