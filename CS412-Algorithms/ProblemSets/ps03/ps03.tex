\begin{questions}
  \question
  \textbf{1. } Explain why the statement, ``The running time of algorithm $A$ is at least $ O(n^2) $,'' is meaningless.
  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

  \question
  \textbf{2. } Prove that the running time of an algorithms if $ \Theta(g(n)) $ if and only if its worst-case running time is $ O(g(n)) $ and its best-case running time is $ \Omega(g(n)) $.
  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

  \question
  \textbf{3. } Prove that $ o(g(n)) \doublecap \omega(g(n)) $ is the empty set.
  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

  \question
  \textbf{4. } Show that $ k \ln k = \Theta(n) \implies k = \Theta(n / \ln) $.
  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

  \question
  \textbf{5. } Show that for any real constants $a$ and $b$, where $ b > 0, (n + a)^b = \Theta(n^b) $.
  \begin{solution}
    
  \end{solution}
