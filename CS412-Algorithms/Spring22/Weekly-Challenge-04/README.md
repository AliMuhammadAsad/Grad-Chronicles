# Purpose

Weekly challenges invite you to critically engage with the topics covered up to that week. They take on a variety of formats and will be available and attempted through diverse platforms as the semester progresses. Each challenge is to be attempted individually.

The task for this challenge is explained in the accompanying prompt which is to be compiled in LaTeX. You will enter your solution in the indicated space in the same file. Make sure to include any supporting files needed for successful compilation. Your file at the time of the submission deadline will be taken to be your submission.

_NOTE_: Acknowledging the amount of effort required, this weekly challenge carries twice the weight and is available for one more week than a usual challenge.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Monday, 14 February.
