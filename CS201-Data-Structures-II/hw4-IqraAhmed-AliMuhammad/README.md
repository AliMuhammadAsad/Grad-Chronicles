# Homework 4: Information Retrieval
# CS 201 Data Structures 2, Spring 2023
-----

This homework explores information retrieval through implementations of trie and inverted index.

# Purpose

This homework provides insight into the trie and inverted index data structures as well as into the field of information retrieval.

# Background

For this assignment, you should
- understand the trie data structure and its related operations
- understand the inverted index data structure and its related operations
- be comfortable with object oriented programming
- be comfortable with programming in  `python`
- be able to problem solve

# The Problem Set

The problem as well as your tasks are described are in `hw4.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Submission

There are 2 parts to this assignment. Lack of submission of any part will result in a loss of marks.

## 3.1 Solving the Problem Set

Please solve the problems as indicated in the problem set and push the relevant files to your GitHub repository. The indicated files in the repository at the time of the deadline will be considered as your submission. Though this submission will not be peer reviewed, try not to include identifying information in it.

This is a __team submission__, i.e. a single submission per team. Your team has a single repository to which each of you will have access. Your team submission will be assigned a __Submission Score__ based on the correctness of the contained solutions.

Deadline: 0900h on Monday, 17 April

## 3.2 Feedback

You will provide feedback on your team and on the assignment by filling the feedback form which will be made available as _HW04 Feedback_ on the course page. This is due at the same time as the problem solutions.

This is an __individual submission__, i.e. each of you has to fill the form. Filling the form contributes to your __Team Factor__ which is 1 by default and is penalized in case of non-submission of the form,  misreporting feedback, or unequal contribution to the submission as reported by your buddies and/or the commit history on GitHub.

Deadline: 0900h on Monday, 17 April

# Grading

Your submission will be graded as per the criteria specified in the accompanying file, _hw4-review.xlsx_. This will contribute to your _Submission Score_.

Your individual score in this homework is the product of your Submission Score and Team Factor.
