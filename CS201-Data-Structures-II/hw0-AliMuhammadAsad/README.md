# Homework 0: OOP and Iterators in `python`
# CS 201 Data Structures 2, Spring 2023
***

# TLDR:
The hw0.pdf file contains the prompt; the requirements of the homework and the tasks we were supposed to perform. This homework was ungraded, and was released for us to get a basic grip on OOP in python as previously we only studied OOP in C++. This homework also familiarised us with `pytest`. We were required to update the files `course.py`, `recipe.py`, and `schedule.py` with our codes - more specifically, implement classes for those scenarios, and then test our code through the files `test_course.py` and `test_recipe.py`. There were no test cases for `schedule.py` so that remains untested, however, the code was still added for that file.  

# Purpose

This assignment will acquaint you with the structure and format of forthcoming assignments. It is meant for your practice and is ungraded but you are highly encouraged to attempt it so as to have an easier time with later, graded assignments.

# Background

To attempt and submit the task you will need
- familiarity with python programming
- familiarity with `pytest`
- comfort with GitHub

# Grading

Grading is done automatically by GitHub. It is recommended that you run `pytest test_course.py test_recipe.py` locally and resolve any issues before `push`ing to your repository.

# Task

The task for this HW0 is explained in the accompanying prompt which is to be compiled in LaTeX. Your score as shown on GitHub at the time of the deadline will be your score in this HW0.

# Deadline and discussion

_Deadline_: 2359h on Friday, 20 Jan
