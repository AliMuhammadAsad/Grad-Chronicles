# The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw1.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Submission

There are 3 parts to this assignment. Lack of submission of any part will result in a loss of marks.

## 1.1 Solving the Problem Set

Please solve the problems as indicated in the problem set and push the relevant files to your GitHub repository. The indicated files in the repository at the time of the deadline will be considered as your submission. As your submission will be partly graded by your peers, please do not include identifying information in it.

This is a __team submission__, i.e. a single submission per team. Your team has a single repository to which each of you will have access. Your team submission will be assigned a __Submission Score__ based on the correctness of the contained solutions.

Deadline: 2359h on Mon, 6 Feb

## 1.2 Feedback

You will provide feedback on your team and on the assignment by filling the feedback form which will be made available as _HW 1.2_ under the _Assignments_ module on the course page. This is due at the same time as the problem solutions.


This is an __individual submission__, i.e. each of you has to fill the form. Filling the form contributes to your __Team Factor__ which is 1 by default and is penalized in case of non-submission of the form,  misreporting feedback, or unequal contribution to the submission as reported by your buddies and/or the commit history on GitHub.

Deadline: 2359h on Mon, 6 Feb
