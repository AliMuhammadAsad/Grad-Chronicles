# Homework 2: Skiplists and Dynamic List ADT
# CS 201 Data Structures 2, Spring 2023
-----

This homework explores skiplists and Dynamic List ADT through implementation and through conceptual problems.

# Purpose

This homework provides insight into skiplists and Dynamic List ADT. In some cases, this is achieved by asking you to implement the structure. In others, through asking you to think about slight variations to the default structure. 

# Background

For this assignment, you should
- understand linked list and dynamic array data structures
- understand the skiplist data structure 
- understand the operations supported by skiplists, especially *find_predecessor()*.
- be comfortable reading the book
- be comfortable with object oriented programming
- be comfortable with programming in a high level language, preferably python
- be able to problem solve

# The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw2.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Submission

There are 2 parts to this assignment. Lack of submission of any part will result in a loss of marks.

## 2.1 Solving the Problem Set

Please solve the problems as indicated in the problem set and push the relevant files to your GitHub repository. The indicated files in the repository at the time of the deadline will be considered as your submission. 

This is a __team submission__, i.e. a single submission per team. Your team has a single repository to which each of you will have access. Your team submission will be assigned a __Submission Score__ based on the correctness of the contained solutions.

Deadline: 0900h on Monday, 27 Feb

## 2.2 Feedback

You will provide feedback on your team and on the assignment by filling the feedback form which will be made available as _HW 2.2_ under the _Assignments_ module on the course page. This is due at the same time as the problem solutions.

This is an __individual submission__, i.e. each of you has to fill the form. Filling the form contributes to your __Team Factor__ which is 1 by default and is penalized in case of non-submission of the form,  misreporting feedback, or unequal contribution to the submission as reported by your buddies and/or the commit history on GitHub.

Deadline: 0900h on Monday, 27 Feb

# Grading

Your submission will be graded as per the criteria specified in the accompanying file, _hw2-review.xlsx_. This will contribute to your _Submission Score_.

Your individual score in this homework is the product of your Submission Score and Team Factor.

# Discussion

This is a lengthy and extensive assignment. It is complicated and daunting. And there is a lot to take in. So do not be shy to reach out! In case of confusion or lack of clarity, do not hesitate to contact the course staff. We also encourage you to

- discuss with your buddy,
- post in the discussion thread linked in the _Assignments_ module on the course page on Canvas.
