\begin{problem}{9}
Determine whether $\forall x (P(x) \implies Q(x))$ and $\forall x P(x) \implies \forall x Q(x)$ are logically equivalent. Justify your answer.
\end{problem}

\begin{questions}
    \question
    \begin{solution}

        The first statement says that for all $x$, if $ P(x) $ then $ Q(x) $. While the second statement says that for all $x$, if $ P(x) $, then for all $Q(x)$. \\ 
        These are obviously not logically equivalent as by the first statement, if for any $x, P(x)$ is true, then $ Q(x) $ is also true for that $x$. However, the second statement says that if $ P(x) $ is true for any $x$, then $ Q(x) $ is true for all $x$. \\ 
        Consider, \\ 
        Let $ P(x) $ be the statement ``$x$ is a fish'' \\ 
        Let $ Q(x) $ be the statement ``$x$ can fly when it rains'' 
        
        Then by the first statement, if $x$ is a fish, then $x$ can fly when it rains. \\ 
        However, by the second statemnt, if any $x$ is a fish, then all fishes can fly when it rains. \\ 
        Hence they are not logically equivalent.
    \end{solution}
\end{questions}

\begin{problem}{10}

\end{problem}

        We can use the argument in Problem 9 for this, however, keep in mind the double implication.
    \end{solution}
\end{questions}

\begin{problem}{11}
Show that  $\exists x (P(x) \lor Q(x))$ and $\exists x P(x) \lor \exists x Q(x)$ are logically equivalent.
\end{problem}

\begin{questions}
    \question
    \begin{solution}

        Both are going to be true if anyone of $ P(x) $ or $ Q(x) $ are true for at least one value of $x$ in the domain | whatever the domain is [universe of discourse].
    \end{solution}
\end{questions}
% \pagebreak
\begin{problem}{12}
Show that  $\forall x P(x) \lor \forall Q(x)$ and $\forall x (P(x) \lor Q(x))$ are not logically equivalent.
\end{problem}

\begin{questions}
    \question
    \begin{solution}

        The first statement says that either one of the two predicates, $ P(x) $ or $ Q(x) $ holds while the second statement says that for every $x$, either $ P(x) $ or $ A(x) $ holds. 

        A simple counterexample can be considering the predicates for the domain of all integers; \\ Let $ P(x) $ be the statement that $x$ is even \\ Let $ Q(x) $ be the statement that $x$ is odd. 
        
        The first proposition will be false as neither all integers are even [$ P(x) $] and neither all integers are odd [$ Q(x) $], however, the second proposition is true since any integer is either going to be even, or it is going to be odd. So either $ P(x) $  or $ Q(x) $ is going to be true. 

        Hence they are not logically equivalent.
    \end{solution}
\end{questions}

\begin{problem}{13}
Show that  $\exists x P(x) \land \exists x Q(x)$ and $\exists x (P(x) \land Q(x))$ are not logically equivalent.
\end{problem}

\begin{questions}
    \question
    \begin{solution}

        The first statement says that there exists an $x$ for which $ P(x) $ holds or there exists an $x$ for which $ Q(x) $ holds while the second statement states that there exists an $x$ for which $ P(x) $ and $ Q(x) $ both hold. 

        A simple counterexample can be considering the predicates for the domain of all integers; \\ Let $ P(x) $ be the statement that $x$ is even \\ Let $ Q(x) $ be the statement that $x$ is odd. 

        The first proposition will be true as there do exist some even integers and there do exist some odd integers. However, the second proposition will be false as there does not exist any integer that is both even and odd.
    \end{solution}

            \item[(d)] There is some student who has been sent an e-mail by every student in your class. \\ This is not the same as (c) since the order of the quantifiers matter. Here, the existential quantification on $y$ comes first, meaning that every person sent an e-mail message to the same person.
            \item[(e)] Every student in your class has been sent an e-mail message by some student.
            \item[(f)] Every student in your class has sent an e-mail message to every student in your class.
