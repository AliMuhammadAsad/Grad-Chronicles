# Discrete_Mathematics_Spring23
This iteration of the course Discrete Mathematics contains weekly challenges, problem set etc related that were covered in the Spring 23 iteration of this course. By this time I was a Teacher's Assistant for this course.

**wcxx** refers to Weekly Challenge and xx represent numbers referring to the week number, so wc01 would mean Weekly Challenge Week 01.

**psxx** refers to Problems Sets and xx represent number referring to the problem set number, so ps01 would mean Problem Set Week 01.
