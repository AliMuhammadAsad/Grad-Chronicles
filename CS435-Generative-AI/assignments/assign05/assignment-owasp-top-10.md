## **Assignment: OWASP Top Ten for LLM (2025)**

### **Objective**

1. **Learn & Research**: Familiarize yourself with the **OWASP Top Ten for Large Language Models (LLM) 2025**.  
2. **Select an Item**: Choose **one** issue from the Top Ten that interests you or seems especially significant.  
3. **Real-World Impact**: Investigate how that issue could (or does) affect an actual enterprise or project.  
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Propose one or two strategies to address or mitigate this specific risk.

### **Instructions**

1. **Review OWASP Top Ten for LLM (2025)**  
   - Conduct a brief **online search** for the updated OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities list specific to LLMs.  
   - Examples of potential vulnerabilities include **Prompt Injection**, **Data Poisoning**, **Model Extraction**, etc.  
   - **Tip**: If official documents for 2025 are not yet finalized, use the **current or draft** references that discuss emerging LLM threats.

2. **Pick One Vulnerability**  
   - Read through each item to find one that stands out to you based on your **interests** or **career goals**.  
   - Clearly **state** which OWASP vulnerability you are focusing on and **why** you selected it.

3. **Real-World Application**  
   - Identify a **real project or enterprise** example where this vulnerability might manifest.  
   - This can be a hypothetical scenario drawn from real industry practices (e.g., **financial services** using an LLM for client data analysis, an **e-commerce** chatbot, a **healthcare** triage system, etc.).  
   - Discuss **how** the vulnerability could be exploited, what damage it might cause (financial, reputational, privacy breach, etc.), and **which stakeholders** might be affected.

4. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**  
   - Propose **at least one or two** concrete techniques or approaches that could reduce the risk.  
   - Consider both **technical** (e.g., better input sanitization, rate limiting, encryption) and **process/policy** solutions (e.g., security audits, staff training, regulatory compliance).

5. **Submission Format**  
   - **Short Written Report** (1â€“2 pages) or a **slide deck** summarizing:  
     1. **Vulnerability Name** (from OWASP Top Ten for LLM)  
     2. **Description** (brief overview in your own words)  
     3. **Real-World Impact** (case study or scenario)  
     4. **Proposed Mitigations**  
     5. **Conclusion/Reflection** (why this matters for LLM projects now and in the future)

## **Brief Grading Rubric**

| **Criteria**                          | **Excellent (A)**                                                           | **Good (B)**                                                              | **Fair (C)**                                                               | **Needs Improvement (D/F)**                                                |
|:------------------------------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vulnerability Understanding**       | Shows deep understanding of selected LLM-specific risk; explains clearly.    | Demonstrates solid grasp, minor gaps in detail or clarity.                | Basic explanation, missing technical depth or clarity on LLM specifics.     | Minimal or vague explanation; not clearly tied to LLM context.              |
| **Real-World Application**           | Presents a detailed, plausible scenario linking the risk to real enterprise.  | Provides a reasonable scenario, with some practical details.              | Scenario is generic or loosely tied to a real project context.              | No real-world context; purely theoretical with little to no detail.         |
| **Mitigation Strategies**            | Proposes well-reasoned, feasible solutions addressing both tech & process.    | Suggests at least one solid measure; some supporting detail.              | Provides general or high-level measures; lacks specifics.                   | Little to no practical mitigation steps offered.                            |
| **Clarity & Organization**           | Highly organized, concise, free of major errors; arguments flow logically.     | Well-structured, minor errors, still clear and coherent.                  | Some structural issues or unclear points, but overall understandable.       | Disorganized or confusing writing; frequent errors hinder comprehension.    |
| **Overall Depth & Reflection**       | Insightful analysis, clear relevance to broader AI security landscape.        | Good effort; shows awareness of AI security implications.                 | Basic reflection on importance; lacks nuance or deeper insight.            | No meaningful reflection or connection to broader LLM security concerns.    |
