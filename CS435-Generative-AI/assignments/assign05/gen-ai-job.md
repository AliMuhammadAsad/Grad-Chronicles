### **Instructions**

1. **Locate and Document a Real Job Description**  
   - Find a **recent job posting** (from reputable job boards, company career pages, LinkedIn, etc.) in an area relevant to your interests:  
     - Generative AI (e.g., Large Language Models, text-to-image synthesis)  
     - AI Safety (e.g., alignment research, responsible AI development)  
     - AI Security (e.g., adversarial robustness, model protection)  
     - AI Ethics & Governance (e.g., fairness, accountability, transparency)  
   - Include **direct excerpts or a link** to the job posting. Make sure it is **publicly accessible** and **current** (posted within the last 2-3 months).  
   - If the posting disappears, provide a screenshot or saved copy.

2. **Analyze the Job Requirements**  
   - Summarize **key responsibilities** (e.g., “Develop machine learning models for image generation,” “Conduct security risk assessments,” “Design robust AI systems,” etc.).  
   - List the **required (and preferred) skills and qualifications** (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, mathematics background, security protocols, knowledge of AI governance).  
   - **Identify** any references to **soft skills** (teamwork, communication, research abilities).

3. **Self-Assessment: What You Already Know**  
   - Reflect on your coursework, projects, internships, or research experiences.  
   - **Map** what you know to the job’s requirements. For instance, if the job requires experience with TensorFlow, highlight your relevant class project. If it asks for knowledge of adversarial attacks, reference a course module or personal project.

4. **Knowledge & Skill Gaps**  
   - Pinpoint **requirements you do NOT fully meet**: for example, “prior experience with generative adversarial networks,” “model interpretability techniques,” “formal verification methods,” “cybersecurity best practices,” or certain **industry certifications**.  
   - For each gap, **describe it succinctly** (e.g., “I have theoretical knowledge from lectures but no hands-on experience with X technology”).

5. **Action Plan for Filling the Gaps**  
   - For each identified gap, outline a **clear objective** and **strategy** to meet the requirement. Your action plan might include:  
     - Specific **courses** or **online modules** to enroll in (e.g., Coursera, edX, specialized workshops).  
     - **Research papers**, textbooks, or **tutorials** to read or follow.  
     - **Personal projects** you intend to complete (e.g., “Train a small LLM from scratch using open-source code”).  
     - **Networking** or mentorship strategies (e.g., “Join an open-source AI project,” “Seek guidance from a professor,” “Attend a relevant conference or meetup”).  
     - Proposed **timelines** or milestones (e.g., “Complete a security fundamentals course by the end of semester,” “Have a prototype model in a GitHub repository within two months”).  

6. **Submission Format**  
   - **Part 1: Job Description & Overview**  
     - Include the job title, company name, link (and/or screenshot) to the posting, and date of posting.  
     - Provide a concise overview of the role and its relevance to AI (generative, safety, security, ethics, etc.).  

   - **Part 2: Skills Breakdown**  
     - Summarize the required skills and qualifications.  
     - Clearly note what you **already meet** vs. what you do **not meet**.  

   - **Part 3: Gap Analysis & Action Plan**  
     - Create a table or bullet list of the **missing skills** or knowledge areas.  
     - For each, explain:  
       1. **Objective** (What do you want to achieve or learn?)  
       2. **Methods** (How do you plan to achieve it—courses, projects, mentors, etc.?)  
       3. **Timeline** (When will you complete it?)  

   - **Part 4: Reflection**  
     - Summarize how this exercise has helped you understand your readiness for such roles and how it shapes your professional growth.

### **Tips for Success**

1. **Be Specific**: The more concrete you are about your *knowledge gaps* and *action steps*, the more useful this assignment will be for your career planning—and the higher your score.  
2. **Use Real Listings**: Employers often update or remove postings quickly, so document your findings properly (take screenshots, note dates, etc.).  
3. **Connect to Your Academic Background**: Reference relevant courses or capstone projects to show where you acquired certain skills or where you need more hands-on practice.  
4. **Be Honest About Limitations**: Identifying gaps is not a weakness; it’s an opportunity to plan your professional development.
