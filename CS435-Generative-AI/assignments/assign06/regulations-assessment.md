## **Your Task**

1. **Choose One Scenario**  
   - From the list of **ten (10) real-world business scenarios** below, pick **one** scenario to analyze in detail.

2. **Apply Each Law/Framework**  
   - For your chosen scenario, determine **which parts** of the five laws or frameworks **apply**.  
   - If the law/framework does **not address** a particular issue in your scenario, **highlight** that gap and offer **recommendations**.

## **Detailed Instructions**

### **1. Scenario Description**

Provide a brief overview of the **specific context** and **challenges** of the scenario you chose. For example, if you pick the “Healthcare Diagnostics” scenario, highlight the types of data collected, how AI is used, the potential biases, and the stakeholders impacted.

### **2. Legal/Framework Analysis**

#### **Pakistan Regulation of AI (2024)**

- **Identify Sections**: Locate any relevant articles or sections (e.g., data privacy, liability, export controls, ethics).  
- **Evidence**: Include **screenshots** or direct quotes of key passages.  
- **Applicability**: Describe **how** these rules would apply to your scenario (or not).  
- **Gaps/Recommendations**: If there is a **gap**, suggest how the regulation could be **amended** or clarified.
