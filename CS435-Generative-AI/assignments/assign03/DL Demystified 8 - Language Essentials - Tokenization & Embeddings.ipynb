    "This Jupyter Notebook is designed to explain the concepts of **tokenization**, **vectors**, and **embeddings** in large language models (LLMs). We will explore these topics from five levels of detail (from a very simple, intuitive explanation all the way to a PhD-level perspective). We'll also cover the intuition, brief history, relevant mathematical foundations, illustrative examples, code demonstrations, a step-by-step building of the technology from scratch, real-world applications, and a glossary of terms.\n",

    "# **1. Building an Intuitive Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Splitting long text into small pieces (like breaking a sentence into words or smaller parts) so that a computer can understand it more easily.\n",
    "- **Vectors**: Numbers in a list that help us describe and compare words and their meanings.\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: Special lists of numbers that capture the meaning of words or sentences so that a computer can understand them better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Cutting sentences into the smallest chunks (tokens). These can be whole words or even parts of words, depending on the method.\n",
    "- **Vectors**: Think of them like coordinates on a map. If you want to show how a word relates to other words, you place it in a space with coordinates (numbers) to find words that are close in meaning.\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: A way of placing words (or text) in a multi-dimensional space. Words with similar meanings end up near each other in this space, helping computers figure out relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: In Natural Language Processing (NLP), tokenization can be **word-based** (split on whitespace), **subword-based** (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding/WordPiece), or **character-based**. This helps handle unknown or complex words.\n",
    "- **Vectors**: Vectors are sequences of numbers representing some property. In NLP, vectors often represent how frequently words appear, or how they might cluster in meaning.\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: Vector representations learned by neural networks. They reduce high-dimensional text data into smaller, more meaningful representations. Popular methods include **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **Transformer-based embeddings** (e.g., from BERT or GPT).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Advanced tokenization strategies use subword tokenizers (like Byte Pair Encoding in GPT or WordPiece in BERT) that allow efficient handling of rare words or new words (\"unseen tokens\"). This avoids issues like large vocabulary sizes.\n",
    "- **Vectors**: Vectors in NLP can be dense (like embeddings) or sparse (like TF-IDF). Dense embeddings capture semantic relationships, while sparse vectors capture raw frequency-based relationships.\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: They are learned by optimizing an objective that places words (or tokens, subwords, sentences) with similar contexts close together in the embedding space. Contextual embeddings (BERT, GPT, etc.) also consider neighboring words, capturing polysemy (words with multiple meanings) more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Strategies are informed by information theory (maximizing token coverage while minimizing the total vocabulary). Byte-level BPE or SentencePiece are typical for large-scale LLMs. The design affects downstream performance on tasks.\n",
    "- **Vectors & Embeddings**:\n",
    "  - Embeddings can be static (Word2Vec) or contextual (BERT, GPT). Contextual embeddings incorporate attention mechanisms that learn dynamic representations based on the entire sentence.\n",
    "  - Mathematical foundation often involves matrix factorization (GloVe) or neural predictive tasks (Word2Vec skip-gram, CBOW). Transformers rely on self-attention layers and multi-head attention.\n",
    "  - Substantial lines of research focus on embedding interpretability, debiasing, and generalization in multi-lingual or multimodal spaces.\n",

    "# **2. Intuition Behind Tokenization, Vectors, and Embeddings**\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Imagine reading a book one letter at a time (very slow) versus reading a book word by word (faster and more meaningful). Tokenization helps a computer chunk text into manageable pieces that still preserve meaning.\n",
    "- **Vectors**: If you want to measure how similar two words are, you need a way to compare them. By converting them into a list of numbers (a vector), we can compute distances (or similarities) between the vectors.\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: The better the numbers in the vector capture the word’s meaning, the more accurate the computer’s understanding. Embeddings are these carefully learned numbers, making it so that words like “king” and “queen” end up near each other, while “apple” is farther away.\n",

    "- **GloVe (2014)** by Stanford researchers used matrix factorization for global word co-occurrences.\n",
    "- **Contextual Embeddings (ELMo, BERT, GPT, Transformers)** overcame the limitation of a single embedding per word by incorporating context using attention.\n",
