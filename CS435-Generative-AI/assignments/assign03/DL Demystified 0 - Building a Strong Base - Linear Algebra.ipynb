    "## **11. Answers & Explanations**\n",
    "1. **Higher-dimensional input**: If you have more features, your weight matrix changes shape. For example, with 3D input and 2D output, the weight matrix is \\(2\\times3\\).\n",
    "2. **Deeper networks**: Stacking more layers adds more transformations, giving the network the ability to learn more complex functions.\n",
    "3. **Activation functions**: Without activations, multiple linear transformations would collapse into a single linear transformation. Activations create non-linearity, allowing the network to capture complex relationships.\n",
    "4. **Classification**: You’d typically use a softmax layer at the end and a cross-entropy loss. The matrix dimension for the last layer equals the number of classes.\n",
    "5. **No biases**: The model might be forced through the origin, possibly limiting its ability to fit data with offsets.\n",
    "6. **Eigenvalues/eigenvectors**: In data transformations (e.g., PCA), the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix represent principal directions. In transformations, they indicate directions that don’t change, only scale.\n",
    "7. **GPUs**: They are highly optimized for parallel computations, such as large-scale matrix multiplications. Without GPUs, training large networks would be prohibitively slow.\n",
