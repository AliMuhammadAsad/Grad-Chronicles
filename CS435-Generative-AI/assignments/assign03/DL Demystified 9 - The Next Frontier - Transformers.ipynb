    "> *“The true art of memory is the art of attention”*  \n",
    "> — Samuel Johnson, Idler #74, September 1759\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we introduce the transformer, the standard architecture for building large language models. Transformer-based large language models have completely changed the field of speech and language processing. Indeed, every subsequent chapter in this textbook will make use of them. We’ll focus for now on left-to-right (sometimes called *causal* or *autoregressive*) language modeling, in which we are given a sequence of input tokens and predict output tokens one by one by conditioning on the prior context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer is a neural network with a specific structure that includes a mechanism called **self-attention** or **multi-head attention**.^1 Attention can be thought of as a way to build contextual representations of a token’s meaning by attending to and integrating information from surrounding tokens, helping the model learn how tokens relate to each other over large spans.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Although multi-head attention developed historically from the RNN attention mechanism (Chapter 8), we’ll define attention from scratch here for readers who haven’t yet read Chapter 8.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Stacked Transformer Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer-based language models are complex, and so the details will unfold over the next 5 chapters. In the next sections we’ll introduce multi-head attention, the rest of the transformer block, and the input encoding and language modeling head components. Chapter 10 discusses how language models are pretrained, and how tokens are generated via sampling. Chapter 11 introduces masked language modeling and the BERT family of bidirectional transformer encoder models. Chapter 12 shows how to prompt LLMs to perform NLP tasks by giving instructions and demonstrations, and how to align the model with human preferences. Chapter 13 will introduce machine translation with the encoder-decoder architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.1 Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from Chapter 6 that for word2vec and other static embeddings, the representation of a word’s meaning is always the same vector irrespective of the context: the word *chicken*, for example, is always represented by the same fixed vector. So a static vector for the word *it* might somehow encode that this is a pronoun used for animals and inanimate entities. But in context it has a much richer meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider *it* in one of these two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The chicken didn’t cross the road because it was too tired.  \n",
    "2. The chicken didn’t cross the road because it was too wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "In (1) *it* is the chicken (i.e., the reader knows that the chicken was tired), while in (2) *it* is the road (and the reader knows that the road was wide).^2\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, if we are to compute the meaning of this sentence, we’ll need the meaning of *it* to be associated with the *chicken* in the first sentence and associated with the *road* in the second one, sensitive to the context. Furthermore, consider reading left to right like a causal language model, processing the sentence up to the word *it*:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The chicken didn’t cross the road because it\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we don’t yet know which thing *it* is going to end up referring to! So a representation of *it* at this point might have aspects of both *chicken* and *road* as the reader is trying to guess what happens next.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fact that words have rich linguistic relationships with other words that may be far away pervades language. Consider two more examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The keys to the cabinet are on the table.  \n",
    "2. I walked along the pond, and noticed one of the trees along the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "In (1), the phrase *The keys* is the subject of the sentence, and in English and many languages, must agree in grammatical number with the verb *are*; in this case both are plural. In English we can’t use a singular verb like *is* with a plural subject like *keys* (we’ll discuss agreement more in Chapter 18). In (2), we know that *bank* refers to the side of a pond or river and not a financial institution because of the context, including words like *pond*. (We’ll discuss word senses more in Chapter 11.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of all these examples is that these contextual words that help us compute the meaning of words in context can be quite far away in the sentence or paragraph. Transformers can build contextual representations of word meaning, *contextual embeddings*, by integrating the meaning of these helpful contextual words. In a transformer, layer by layer, we build up richer and richer contextualized representations of the meanings of input tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.1.1 Attention more formally\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention is the mechanism in the transformer that weighs and combines the representations from appropriate other tokens in the context from layer $k-1$ to layer $k$. A simplified version of the attention is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_i = \\sum_{j \\le i} \\alpha_{ij} x_j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha_{ij}$ is how much $x_j$ should contribute to $a_i$. In attention, we weight each prior embedding proportionally to how similar it is to the current token $x_i$. We compute similarity scores via dot product, normalize with softmax, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A single attention head using query, key, and value matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers use multiple weight matrices $W^Q$, $W^K$, $W^V$ to transform each input vector $x_i$ into **query**, **key**, and **value** representations. Then we compute dot products of query vs. key, scale them, apply softmax, and use them to weight the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "q_i = x_i W^Q; \\quad k_j = x_j W^K; \\quad v_j = x_j W^V;\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "score(x_i, x_j) = \\frac{q_i \\cdot k_j}{\\sqrt{d_k}};\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha_{ij} = softmax(score(x_i, x_j)) \\quad \\forall j \\le i;\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "head_i = \\sum_{j \\le i} \\alpha_{ij} v_j; \\quad a_i = head_i W^O.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In **multi-head attention**, we repeat this process with multiple heads, each with its own $W^Q, W^K, W^V$. Then we concatenate the outputs of each head and project them back to dimension $d$ with another weight matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.2 Transformer Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-attention calculation lies at the core of what’s called a transformer block, which, in addition to the self-attention layer, includes three other kinds of layers: (1) a feedforward layer, (2) residual connections, and (3) normalizing layers (layer norm).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer Norm\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer normalization ($LayerNorm$) helps keep the values of hidden layers in a stable range for gradient-based training. For a given vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i=1}^{d} x_i, \\quad\n",
    "\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i=1}^{d}(x_i - \\mu)^2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Then\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x} = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}, \\quad LayerNorm(x) = \\gamma \\hat{x} + \\beta.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedforward Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "FFN(x) = ReLU(xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "The function computed by a transformer block can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_1 = LayerNorm(X), \\quad\n",
    "T_2 = MultiHeadAttention(T_1), \\quad\n",
    "T_3 = T_2 + X,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_4 = LayerNorm(T_3), \\quad\n",
    "T_5 = FFN(T_4), \\quad\n",
    "H = T_5 + T_3.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We stack many such transformer blocks for large language models (12, 24, 96, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.3 Parallelizing computation using a single matrix X\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of processing one token at a time, we pack input embeddings for the $N$ tokens of the input into a single matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$. This lets us efficiently compute attention using matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.4 The input: embeddings for token and position\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent inputs, we combine **word embeddings** (from an embedding matrix $E$) and **positional embeddings** to form $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$. For left-to-right language models, we also add a **causal mask** so that each token can only attend to tokens at earlier positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.5 The Language Modeling Head\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for language modeling, we have a **language modeling head** on top of the final transformer block output. Often we *tie* the unembedding matrix to the embedding matrix $E$ by using its transpose. If $h_N^L$ is the final hidden state for the last token, then the logits $u$ and word probabilities $y$ are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u = h_N^L E^T, \\quad y = softmax(u).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then sample (or otherwise decode) from these probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.6 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transformers use **multi-head self-attention** to combine information from across the input.\n",
    "- A **transformer block** has self-attention, a feedforward layer, residual connections, and layer norms.\n",
    "- For language modeling, we use a **decoder-only** transformer that is masked so each token can only attend to previous tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bibliographical and Historical Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) was developed from earlier concepts of self-attention and memory networks. The concept of attention originated in RNN-based sequence-to-sequence models (Bahdanau et al., 2015), then extended to self-attention (Cheng et al., 2016). Other aspects derived from memory networks (Weston et al., 2015; Graves et al., 2014).\n",

    "Imagine you’re reading a story. Each word in the story needs to know about the words before it to make sense of what is happening. A **Transformer** is like a big helper that looks at all the words you’ve already read and decides which ones are most important to understanding the next word. It does this using a trick called **attention**, which helps the model “focus” on the right words when figuring out the meaning of the current word. By doing this many times, Transformers learn to predict and create text that sounds just like people wrote it."

    "A Transformer takes a sentence (or a large chunk of text) and turns each word into a bunch of numbers (an *embedding*). Then, it uses something called **self-attention** to see how each word connects to every other word. This way, the model isn’t just looking at neighbors (like a small window around a word), it can look at the *whole sentence or paragraph* at once. This self-attention step is repeated in layers, each time refining how the words relate to each other. In the end, the model learns a powerful representation of the text that lets it do tasks like predicting the next word or completing entire sentences."

    "Transformers represent each token (word or subword) in a vector space. They compute **query**, **key**, and **value** vectors for each token in parallel. The **queries** are used to look up relevant **keys** across all tokens, and the corresponding **values** are combined based on similarity scores. This process, known as **multi-head self-attention**, is repeated several times with **feedforward layers**, **residual connections**, and **layer normalization**. By stacking multiple Transformer blocks, the model captures global context and learns intricate linguistic patterns. The final layer, known as the **language modeling head**, transforms these representations into a distribution over possible next tokens (words)."

    "A Transformer encodes each input token $x_i$ into a vector. Within each Transformer block, a **multi-head self-attention** layer is applied: each head has distinct learnable weight matrices $W^Q, W^K, W^V$ to create query ($q_i$), key ($k_j$), and value ($v_j$) vectors. We compute dot products $q_i \\cdot k_j$, scale them by $\\sqrt{d_k}$, apply a softmax, and multiply by $v_j$ to get the final attention output. Multiple heads are concatenated and projected to maintain dimension consistency. This output feeds into a **feedforward network** with potential dimension expansion. **Residual connections** add the input of each sub-layer to its output, and **layer normalization** maintains stable activations. Stacking multiple such layers yields a deep, contextualized representation of all tokens. Positional embeddings or encodings are added to represent sequence order. For language modeling, a final projection (often tied to the embedding matrix) provides logits over the vocabulary."

Causal (left-to-right) masking ensures that the model cannot attend to future tokens, preserving autoregressive capabilities. Output embeddings are mapped back to vocabulary logits via weight tying with $E^T$.

    "- **Bias (b)**: An additional learnable parameter (vector) sometimes used in feedforward layers (not shown in the above snippet, but used in standard linear layers).\n",
    "- **Dot Product**: The multiplication of two vectors, resulting in a scalar that indicates how similar or aligned they are.\n",
    "- **Softmax**: A function that turns a vector of real numbers into probabilities that sum to 1.\n",
    "- **Mask**: In causal language modeling, we mask out future tokens so the model doesn’t “cheat” by seeing them.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **\"How can a Transformer handle long-distance dependencies in text?\"**  \n",
    "   *Answer:* By using self-attention that can attend to any token in the sequence, not just local neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **\"Why do we need positional embeddings if the model can see all tokens at once?\"**  \n",
    "   *Answer:* Because without some notion of order, the model wouldn’t know how the tokens are arranged in time/space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **\"What is multi-head attention?\"**  \n",
    "   *Answer:* Multiple attention heads allow the model to learn different types of relationships in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **\"Why use residual connections and layer norm?\"**  \n",
    "   *Answer:* They help stabilize and speed up training, preventing vanishing or exploding gradients and allowing deeper architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **\"How is a Transformer different from an RNN?\"**  \n",
    "   *Answer:* An RNN processes tokens sequentially, which can be slower for long sequences, while a Transformer processes all tokens in parallel via attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **\"What does the language modeling head do?\"**  \n",
    "   *Answer:* It projects the final hidden state of each token position into a distribution over the vocabulary, allowing next-token prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **\"How do we prevent a Transformer from looking at future tokens during training for language modeling?\"**  \n",
