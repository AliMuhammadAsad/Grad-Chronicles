    "### Intuitive Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to read a sentence in another language. You want to find the best way to turn it into English so you can understand it. A **Transformer** is like a very clever friend that reads sentences in one language, learns what each word really means by looking at all the other words, and then writes it out in another language.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We split the sentence into \"pieces\" (tokens or words) so it can read them one at a time.\n",
    "2. The **Transformer** has two main parts:\n",
    "   - An **Encoder** that reads the words.\n",
    "   - A **Decoder** that writes the translation.\n",
    "3. Inside, there's **attention**, a way for the Transformer to focus on the words that matter the most. For example, if we have a sentence \"The cat sat on the mat because it was tired,\" the word **\"it\"** might need to look closely at **\"cat\"** to know that \"it\" means \"the cat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "By using **attention**, the Transformer can figure out how different words in a sentence connect to each other and then produce an accurate translation (or do other tasks like summarization or text generation). That's the simplest picture!\n"

    "### More Detail on Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Transformer** is a type of deep learning model that excels in understanding and generating language. It's used in things like **ChatGPT**, **Google Translate**, and many other AI-based language tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encoder**: Takes a sentence (like \"Il fait beau aujourd'hui\" in French) and transforms it into a hidden representation (a bunch of numbers that the computer can understand).\n",
    "- **Decoder**: Uses that hidden representation to generate an English sentence (e.g., \"The weather is nice today\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Key ideas:\n",
    "1. **Self-Attention**: Each word in the sentence can \"attend\" to every other word. For the word \"it\" in the example above, the model looks at all other words to see which word \"it\" should refer to.\n",
    "2. **Positional Encoding**: Transformers don't process words one after another in a chain (like older RNNs do). Instead, they process them all at once. We still need to tell the model which word is first, second, etc. *Positional encoding* does this by adding specific patterns of numbers to the word representations.\n",
    "3. **Multi-Head Attention**: Instead of using just one attention map, we use multiple. Imagine multiple sets of eyes looking at the sentence in different ways, each capturing some nuance of meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Transformer model can read the entire sentence at once, figure out important relationships, and then generate a whole new sentence in the target language.\n"

    "### The Architecture Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a sentence of length $N$. We break it up into tokens (words/pieces). The Transformer has:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Embeddings**: Convert each token into a vector of real numbers (dimension $d$).\n",
    "2. **Positional Encodings**: Add a positional encoding to each token embedding to mark its position in the sequence.\n",
    "3. **Encoder Stack**: $N$ tokens go into the bottom encoder. Each encoder has:\n",
    "   - A **Multi-Head Self-Attention** sub-layer: the model learns to pay attention to parts of the input.\n",
    "   - A **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)** sub-layer: a small neural network that processes each position independently.\n",
    "   - **Residual** connections and **Layer Normalization** around each sub-layer.\n",
    "4. **Decoder Stack**: Takes the previously generated tokens as input and does almost the same steps, but also has an **\"encoder-decoder attention\"** that looks at the output of the **encoder stack**.\n",
    "5. **Final Linear + Softmax**: The decoder output is turned into a probability distribution over all possible words in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-Attention in a Nutshell\n",
    "For each word, we create 3 vectors:\n",
    "- **Query (Q)**\n",
    "- **Key (K)**\n",
    "- **Value (V)**\n",
    "\n",
    "All words produce Q, K, and V. The attention for a given word is computed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q K^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors. This gives us a weighted sum of the values, with weights determined by how well the query matches the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "We do that self-attention multiple times in parallel (heads). Each head learns to pay attention to different relationships or patterns in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Transformers?\n",
    "- They allow parallel processing of the entire sentence.\n",
    "- Self-attention can capture long-range dependencies better than older RNN-based approaches.\n",
    "- Achieves **state-of-the-art** results on many language tasks.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Encoder**:\n",

    "Each encoder layer $\\ell$ (for $\\ell = 1, ..., L$) has:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Layer Normalization** on the input:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_1 = \\text{LayerNorm}(X_{\\ell-1}).\n",

    "$$\n",
    "   where each head $h$ has its own projection matrices $W^h_Q, W^h_K, W^h_V$ to get Q, K, V.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add & Norm** (a residual connection):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z = X_{\\ell-1} + \\text{MHA}(T_1).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "4. Another **Layer Normalization**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T_2 = \\text{LayerNorm}(Z).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "5. **Feed-Forward Network** (FFN):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{FFN}(T_2) = \\max(0, T_2 W_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "6. **Add & Norm** again:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_{\\ell} = Z + \\text{FFN}(T_2).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we get the next layer's input. After $L$ layers, the final output of the encoder stack is $X_L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoder** has a similar structure, with the modification:\n",
    "- We apply **Masked** Multi-Head Self-Attention (so the decoder cannot peek at future tokens in the output sequence).\n",
    "- We have an extra multi-head attention that uses the **encoder output** as the keys and values, and the decoder hidden states as queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "We use a **cross-entropy loss** across the entire sequence. For each position in the output sentence, we want the correct word to have the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "- Self-attention is $O(N^2 \\times d)$. This is why it's sometimes expensive for large sequences, but faster in practice than very deep recurrent networks for many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary So Far\n",
    "- The Transformer is a stack of encoders and decoders.\n",
    "- Each uses (1) multi-head self-attention, (2) feed-forward, (3) residual connections, (4) layer normalization.\n",
    "- The decoder is also conditioned on the encoder outputs and prevents attending to future output words.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Learned Embeddings** $E$: Typically dimension $d$. For a vocabulary size $|V|$, $E \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|V| \\times d}$. Input tokens become rows in $E$.\n",

    "   - $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_k}$\n",
    "   - Then we do multi-head by replicating this with separate parameters for each head.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Masking**: For decoding, we apply a causal mask so the output at time $t$ can only attend to earlier times (1 to $t-1$), not future times.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Linear**: We often share embedding weights with the final linear (\"unembedding\") step (weight tying), ensuring a large matrix doesn't blow up parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Optimization**: Often we use the **Adam** or **Adafactor** optimizer with warm-up learning rates.\n",

    "### Example: Short Sentence Translation\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. We have **Input**: \"Le chat dort\" (meaning \"The cat sleeps\").\n",
    "2. The **Encoder** transforms [\"Le\", \"chat\", \"dort\"] into some high-level representation.\n",
    "3. The **Decoder** uses these representations to generate [\"The\", \"cat\", \"is\", \"sleeping\"] or something close.\n",

    "1. Each French word is turned into an embedding: `[[LE_vec], [CHAT_vec], [DORT_vec]]`.\n",

    "3. The final encoder output is passed to the decoder.\n",

    "3. **Beyond MT**: The same architecture is used for chatbots, code generation, summarization, and so on.\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameters**: Often chosen empirically. Common dimension sizes are 256, 512, or 1024, with multiple heads (e.g., 8 or 16 heads) and anywhere from 6 to 96 layers.\n",
    "5. **Parallelization**: Self-attention operates across the entire input in parallel, leading to faster training on modern hardware.\n"
