This repository contains the notes, lectures, assignments, and quizzes for the course CS/CE-232/324: Operating Systems offered in the Fall 2023 iteration. The notes folder also contains the ```codes``` files that contains the codes related to and mentioned in the course book (also given as a pdf), ```Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces```.

The first two labs were solely on getting familiar with the operating system. (The .sh file for the commands will also be updated with time)

By this time, before the course started, I had already started to explore various Linux operating systems; naturally starting with Ubuntu, however, settling with Linux Mint <img width="18px" src="https://seeklogo.com/images/L/linux-mint-logo-49124587FE-seeklogo.com.png"/> as for me, it was great with its sleek, modern yet comfy look, feel and the options especially gestures etc it provided.
